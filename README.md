# GetVideoGameData

GetVideoGameData.py is a script i wrote to pull game titles, genres, and ESRB ratings using Giantbomb's api.

## Motivation
I wanted to use data to explore if there are differences in the types of games available on the Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. 

I have included the data I pulled down as CSV files.  And have included Excel spreadsheets with tables with 
raw data (GamesData.xls) and with the Genre counts broken down by platform (GenreData.xls).  

The Tableau visualization using this data is at:

## Usage

I used the PyCharm IDE.  You will need a Giantbomb api key.  You also need to limit your api calls 
to one per second or slower.  


## License
You are free to use the script or data.  If you use the data, you must give Giantbomb credit.
