# Bollinger Bands

Bollinger.py is a script to calculate and plot Bollinger Bands for a stock.

## Overview
I wrote this to calculate Bollinger bands for a stock using a .csv file with daily price data when I 
was studying the lectures and homeworks for a Machine Learning for Trading class.  Numpy, Pandas, and 
matplotlib are used.

Bollinger Bands have a centerline which is a 20 day moving average and upper and lower bands which are  
2 standard deviations above and below the centerline.

This is used as a technical trading indicator of how strong a trend is and when it is likely to reverse
